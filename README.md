takes a number from input.txt

which is the minimum of the range defined by

#define interval_size 100 (i.e. see if 100 elements of the form 12*x+5 are prime [interval_size can also be increased])

and returns all primes of the form 12*x+5 in that range

I apologize if I didn't use dynamic memory allocation
